			<h1>How does it work?</h1>
			<p>
				<u>Blockchain Technology</u><br>
				This voting system utilizes a blockchain-style database to store user information and votes.
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Wikipedia
				describes blockchains</a> as "a continuously growing list of records, called <i>blocks</i>, which are 
				linked and secured using cryptography." This list of records is essentially a ledger of transaction
				history. Exact copies of the ledger are kept on multiple computers, called <i>nodes</i>, across a wide network. Each computer 
				routinely compares its copy	of the ledger against all others on the network as transactions take place. 
				This way the ownership of digital assets is always tracked, so no one can cheat the sytem by "double 
				spending" an asset or lying about the amount of assets they own.<br>
				<u>Applying Blockchains to Voting</u><br>
				The blockchain principle previously described can be used to allow voters to cast votes and have them
				securely stored. The digital asset becomes the vote to be cast, and the ledger becomes a record of votes
				being sent from voters to respective candidates.

			<h1>Is it secure?</h1>
			<p>
				<u>Inherent Security</u><br>
				Blockchain ledgers are secure by their nature. New blocks of transactions are added to the chain only after
				a computationally difficult hash algorithm has been solved. All nodes on the network continually attempt
				to solve this algorithm, and, once having done so, they broadcast their solution to all other nodes who 
				verify it. If the majority of nodes agrees on the solution, the new block is added to the chain and the 
				process begins again with the next new block of transactions.
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Wikipedia</a>
				points out, "Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration
				of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority."
